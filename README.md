# Beer Run

Each user creates nominates a prioritized list of their five favorite beers. Beer Run then uses a [Borda count](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count) with [truncated ballots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count#Truncated_ballots) and [multiple winners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count#Multiple_winners) to generate a list of beer prioritized for maximum average happiness amongst voters. Enough jargon for you? The point is, it makes an awesome list of everyone's favorite beers and you can buy beer that will make the group happy.

## Why?!?

Mostly because after RailsConf 2011, we were excited to try out some new libraries we'd heard about and some Rails 3.1 features, so we thought up a simple app to play around with them.

## Help?

Totally:

1. Fork it.
2. Feature branch.
3. Write test.
4. Make test pass.
5. Send pull request.
6. have a beer.
